# Test Results - GBSite E-commerce Application

## Original Problem Statement
User reported: "Pra logar e registrar usuario esta ocorrendo esse erro" - Internal Server Error (500) during login/registration where backend was returning HTML instead of JSON.

## Issue Resolution
**Root Cause:** The supervisor was running the old Flask backend (`server.py` → `src/main.py`) instead of the new FastAPI backend (`main.py`).

**Solution Applied:**
1. Modified `/app/backend/server.py` to import and run FastAPI app instead of Flask app
2. Removed old database files that had schema mismatches (missing `avatar_url` column)
3. Restarted backend service to recreate database with correct schema

## Backend Testing Results

### Manual Authentication Tests (✅ PASSED)
- **Health Check:** `GET /api/health` → Returns proper JSON: `{"status":"ok","message":"GBSite API is running"}`
- **Login:** `POST /api/auth/login` → Returns proper JWT token and user data in JSON format
- **Registration:** `POST /api/auth/register` → Successfully creates users and returns authentication data

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend service running on FastAPI 
- ✅ Authentication endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Database schema properly synchronized
- ✅ JSON responses working (no more HTML errors)

## Testing Protocol
**Testing Agent Communication:**
- MUST read this file before testing
- Update this file after each test cycle
- Focus on testing ALL authentication flows
- Test user management, cart, orders, admin functions
- Report any failures with specific error details

**Next Steps:**
1. Run comprehensive backend testing using deep_testing_backend_v2
2. Ask user permission before frontend testing
3. Verify frontend integration works with fixed backend

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed issue was login/registration Internal Server Error
- Solution delivered: Authentication now works properly
- Backend returns JSON responses as expected
- Ready for comprehensive testing
